// This file is intentionally left blank as it will be deleted.
// The build system requires a non-empty file if it's referenced,
// but since we're deleting it, this content doesn't matter.
// If the file is not deleted by the XML processor, it should be manually removed.
// This is a placeholder to ensure the <delete /> operation works if it's a full file replacement.
// For actual deletion, an IDE or build tool would remove the file from the project structure.
// In this XML format, there isn't a specific "delete file" tag,
// so replacing with empty or a comment indicates it's no longer used.
// Consider this file as conceptually deleted.
